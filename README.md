## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The clock is built using HTML elements for hour, minute, and second hands.  
2. CSS handles the circular design and positioning of hands.  
3. JavaScript calculates the rotation angle for each hand based on the current time.  
4. The hands are rotated every second using the `setInterval()` function.
